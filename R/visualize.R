# Finally, many people will want to visualize text networks. This first function
# requires an igraph object. It begins by pruning edges from the network, since
# most of these edges have very low weight, and therefore create a "hairball" style
# network plot. This requires the user to input a number between 0 and 1 that describes
# the quantile above which edge weights  should be kept. Next, it uses the ggraph package
# to create something resembling a pretty plot. Right now a big problem is that text labels
# take up too much space,  I may move to a heatmap implementation to get at this.
